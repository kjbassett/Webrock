# Webrock
A server that's as simple as a rock, designed to plug and play with any python project you are writing. 
The goal is to simply import the the library and add the @plugin decorator onto any function in your code.
Upon starting the web server it will scan your project and display controls to start, stop, and create a schedule for your functions!
